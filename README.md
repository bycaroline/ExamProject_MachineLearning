# Exam Project in Machine Learning, Java and React

## Description
The purpose of this Exam project is to learn and understand how machine learning works, as well as to apply knowledge in Python and integrate it with Java and React. The product is a service that predicts and estimates air quality in a specific part of Stockholm's inner city. Users simply enter a time of day and select a location within Stockholm's inner city in the browser, and they receive an estimation of the air quality for that time and place.

When the frontend receives an input and sends a request, it passes through the Java server, which forwards the request to a Flask API. The API utilizes the saved model in the joblib file and sends a response back, first to the Java server and then to the frontend client. The user can then read the response and see the estimated air quality. The machine learning model is built in Jupyter Notebooks using Python, Pandas, NumPy, and SciKit Learn.
