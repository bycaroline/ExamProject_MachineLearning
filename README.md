# Exam Project in Machine Learning, Java and React

## Description
This project aims to explore how machine learning works while applying Python skills and integrating them with Java and React. The outcome is a service that predicts and estimates air quality in specific areas of Stockholm's inner city. Users enter a time of day and select a location within Stockholm via a browser, receiving an estimated air quality forecast for their chosen time and place.

The system workflow begins in the frontend, where user input triggers a request. This request is sent to a Java server, which then forwards it to a Flask API. The API leverages a pre-trained machine learning model stored in a joblib file to process the input and generate a prediction. The response is routed back through the Java server to the frontend client, where users can view the estimated air quality. The machine learning model is developed using Python, with tools such as Jupyter Notebooks, Pandas, NumPy, and SciKit Learn.
